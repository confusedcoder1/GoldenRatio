## WHAT THIS ACHEIVES?
- The site is a perfect introduction to anyone who is curious about this mathematical wonder. It provides quick reads on basic introduction to PHI, it's connectivity to various things around, both in(fibonnaci) and out of Mathematics. 
- With the little HandsOn tool, Gallery and HowTo, visual and active introduction is promoted.

## SCOPE
- Project has alot of scope and with some work can be made even more exciting.
- Gallery automation, Improving HandsOn Tool, adding new HandsOn tools, and extending shape support to arcs and spirals, among the many.
